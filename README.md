A Casino like Simulator for Rolling Heroes in the Game Castle Clash.

The Project is based on the mobile game [Castle Clash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.igg.castleclash).
<hr>

This was my first "real" programming project all the way back at the start of 2018.<br>
Before that my only programming experience came from a pseudo language for a selfbuild minecraft server.
